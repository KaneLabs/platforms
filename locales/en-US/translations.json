    "HOST_TICKETING_EXPLANATION": "When you create an event on our platform, you have the ability to define various roles for that event. These roles could be anything from attendees to speakers, volunteers, or any other roles you need for your event.\n\nFor each role, you can create an application process. This involves setting up a series of questions that potential applicants must answer. These questions help you understand if the applicant is a good fit for the role they're applying for. For example, if the role is for a speaker, you might ask them to submit a proposal for their talk.\n\nWhen a user applies for a role at your event, their application is evaluated based on the answers they provide. If their application is successful, they are granted a ticket. This ticket serves as their proof of access to the event in the role they applied for.\n\nIn essence, users are not just applying for a ticket, they're applying for a specific role at your event. The ticket is the result of a successful application and serves as their pass to participate in the event in the capacity of the role they applied for.\n\nThis process allows you to manage and control who has access to your event and in what capacity, ensuring a smooth and well-organized event.",
